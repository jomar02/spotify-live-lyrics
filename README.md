## Requirements

- **Linux** (tested on Arch/CachyOS, should work on Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Spotify** (desktop app or web player)
- **playerctl** - for Spotify integration
- **syncedlyrics** - for fetching lyrics

## Installation

### Arch Linux / CachyOS

```bash
# Install system dependencies
paru -S playerctl python-rich python-pyfiglet

# Install syncedlyrics
pipx install syncedlyrics

# Download the script
curl -o ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomar02/spotify-live-lyrics/main/spotify-live-lyrics.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live
```

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install playerctl python3-pip

# Install Python packages
pip3 install --user rich pyfiglet syncedlyrics

# Download the script
curl -o ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomar02/spotify-live-lyrics/main/spotify-live-lyrics.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live
```

### Other Linux

```bash
# Install playerctl (check your package manager)
# Then install Python packages
pip3 install --user rich pyfiglet syncedlyrics

# Download and install script
curl -o ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomar02/spotify-live-lyrics/main/spotify-live-lyrics.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live
```

## Usage

1. **Start Spotify** and play a song
2. **Run the viewer**:
   ```bash
   lyrics-live
   ```

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Q` | Show lyrics earlier (increase offset) |
| `A` | Show lyrics later (decrease offset) |
| `Z` | Reset offset to 0.0 |
| `X` | Exit viewer |
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit viewer |

The offset resets to 0.0 for each new song.

## Configuration

Edit the script to change default values:

```python
# Timing offset default (in seconds)
TIMING_OFFSET_DEFAULT = 0.0  # Start with no offset

# Color scheme (Nord palette)
NORD_AURORA_YELLOW = "#EBCB8B"  # Current line color
NORD3 = "#4C566A"  # Context lines background
```

## Troubleshooting

### "playerctl is not installed"
Install playerctl using your package manager (see Installation section)

### "No synced lyrics found"
Not all songs have synced lyrics available. The script will wait for the next song.

### Lyrics are off-sync
Use `Q` to make lyrics appear earlier, or `A` to make them appear later. Each press adjusts by 0.1 seconds.

### Spotify not detected
Make sure Spotify is running and actually playing a song (not paused).

## How It Works

1. **playerctl** monitors Spotify playback and provides current position
2. **syncedlyrics** fetches time-synced lyrics from online databases
3. The script parses `.lrc` format lyrics and matches them to playback position
4. **Rich** library renders the beautiful terminal UI with Nord colors
5. Live offset adjustment compensates for any timing differences
