- **Responsive** - Adapts to any terminal size

## Preview

```
              🎵 Artist Name - Song Title
     [Offset: +0.0s | Q=earlier A=later Z=reset X=exit]

                  ...earlier lyrics...
                  a faded past line
                  the line before current        <- blue on dark blue
♪♪              Current lyric line              ♪♪  <- mauve highlight
                  the line after current         <- blue on dark blue
                  upcoming line
                  ...more upcoming lines...
```

The highlighted line always stays in the vertical center of the terminal. Past lines appear above (faded), future lines appear below.

## Requirements

- **Linux** (tested on Arch/CachyOS, should work on Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Spotify** (desktop app)
- **playerctl** - for Spotify integration
- **syncedlyrics** - for fetching lyrics
- **rich** - for terminal UI rendering

## Installation

### Arch Linux / CachyOS

```bash
# Install system dependencies
paru -S playerctl python-rich

# Install syncedlyrics
pipx install syncedlyrics

# Download the script
curl -o ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomar02/spotify-live-lyrics/main/spotify-live-lyrics.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live
```

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install playerctl python3-pip

# Install Python packages
pip3 install --user rich syncedlyrics

# Download the script
curl -o ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomar02/spotify-live-lyrics/main/spotify-live-lyrics.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live
```

### Other Linux

```bash
# Install playerctl (check your package manager)
# Then install Python packages
pip3 install --user rich syncedlyrics

# Download and install script
curl -o ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jomar02/spotify-live-lyrics/main/spotify-live-lyrics.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lyrics-live
```

## Usage

1. **Start Spotify** and play a song
2. **Run the viewer**:
   ```bash
   lyrics-live
   ```

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Q` | Show lyrics earlier (increase offset by 0.1s) |
| `A` | Show lyrics later (decrease offset by 0.1s) |
| `Z` | Reset offset to 0.0 |
| `X` | Exit viewer |
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit viewer |

The offset resets to 0.0 for each new song.

## Configuration

Edit the script to change default values:

```python
# Timing offset default (in seconds)
TIMING_OFFSET_DEFAULT = 0.0

# Color scheme (Catppuccin Mocha)
NORD_AURORA_YELLOW = "#CBA6F7"  # Mauve - current line highlight
NORD3 = "#313244"               # Surface0 - previous/next line background
NORD_SNOW_STORM = "#89B4FA"     # Blue - previous/next line text
```

## Troubleshooting

### "playerctl is not installed"
Install playerctl using your package manager (see Installation section).

### "No synced lyrics found"
Not all songs have synced lyrics available. The script will wait and retry when the song changes.

### Lyrics are off-sync
Use `Q` to make lyrics appear earlier, or `A` to make them appear later. Each press adjusts by 0.1 seconds.

### Spotify not detected
Make sure Spotify is running and actually playing a song (not paused).

## How It Works

1. **playerctl** monitors Spotify playback and returns the current artist, title, and position
2. **syncedlyrics** fetches time-synced `.lrc` lyrics from online databases
3. The script parses the `.lrc` timestamps and finds the line matching the current position
4. **rich** renders the terminal UI: current line centered and highlighted in mauve, surrounding lines in blue
5. The display refreshes at 10 FPS; offset adjustment compensates for timing differences
